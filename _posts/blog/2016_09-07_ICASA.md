# TERRAref RDF model for ICASA

Date: Wednesday, September 7, 2016
Time: 3:00 - 4:00 CST

## Participants

Craig Willis
Cheryl Porter
Jeff White
Noah Fahlgren

## Background

As discussed in reference-data issues # [5](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/5) and # [31](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/31), we&#39;ve been reviewing standard formats for the representation of agronomic and plant trait data (among other things) for TERRA-REF.  We are strongly considering going forward with a format based on the ICASA model and AgMIP JSON Data Objects, but would like to use more of a linked-data approach that allows us to incorporate concepts from other vocabularies/schema.  This means likely creating a reference schema/vocabulary for ICASA in RDFS/OWL or similar.

## Agenda

The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the steps required to create a referenceable ICASA vocabulary or schema.

- Brief review of [TERRA-REF Trait Data Format Sketch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pkt_OBytwx4HioeTCOEQeJKXP4xGGXDmGiwFHWhBqUQ/edit)
  - Page 2 sketches how ICASA could be combined with other standards or TERRA-REF specific vocabularies to capture PlantCV extractor output.
  - NOTE: PlantCV output is also put in Cyverse
  - Q. Genomic/instruments
    - ICASA has always thought to be able to link to it, but not capture it.
  - Action: Venn diagram of PlantCV standards
  - Cyverse:
    - Moving away from metadata in iRods
    - Discovery environment has a metadata DB
    - Will put in Bisque, which has it&#39;s own metadata system
    - Wisconsin group put up a phenotyping dataset
- Brief discussion of ICASA model and AgMIP [JSON Data Objects](http://research.agmip.org/display/dev/JSON+Data+Objects)
  - JSON seems to be the format of choice -- simple to use
    - This gets more complicated when we introduce JSON-LD or JSON Schema
  - Q. Is this used only for AgMIP?
    - Was developed for/by AgMIP and adopted by other researchers using this format because it is convenient.
    - AgMIP is huge -- many activities. The data format is used for the translators and the model intercomparisons.
    - DSSAT modeling software is somewhat compliant, used in a number of countries.
    - USDA has been exposed to the data format and have a proposal in to use it for archiving data -- NARDN
      - AgMIP JSON data objects
      - Extend to include livestock and other domains
  - Q. Is there anything we should know about ICASA or the AgMIP model?
    - For the data archiving project, the ICASA list is just what they need.
    - ICASA is being incorporated into the trait and agronomy ontology
    - JSON DO -- loose schema
      - Experiments
      - Weathers
      - Soils
    - Every dataset is different -- they have a loose definition of required data.
      - Minimum data = lat/long, crop
    - ICASA activity
      - Minimum datasets for different types of uses -- core data that are collected with field experiments/best practices
    - TERRA experiments
      - Controlled environment data
      - Field studies
      - ICASA is weak on protocols and metadata for instruments
    - ICASA is intended for crops, not intended for individual plants
      - Also manual measurements, they take measurements across rows.
- Brief discussion of [ICASA Linked-Data Schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTcTpKxcanPfRKPC-ZG8KjufGHscx5OCCB-5Ti58ARg/edit?usp=drive_web) options
  - _Recommendation_: best-effort RDFS or OWL-based implementation of ICASA model that starts from the AgMIP JSON Data Objects. Something like [http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for ICASA and phenotyping.
  - Note difference between vocabulary, model, and a data format that can be validated.
  - Q. Is this worth doing?
    - Datasets, subsets, groups -- natural structure.
    - LOD - in general, it&#39;s worth doing.
  - Q. What&#39;s the goal (TERRA)
    - To find/define a set of interchange formats for TERRA
    - Genomics and CF community have common practices
    - AgMIP/ICASA
    - If we have our data in a format the AgMIP community can use, that would be good and make the data more useful.
  - Q. Where would we host the authoritative vocabulary?
    - AgMIP will maintain and expand the data dictionary
    - NARDN may generate interested where NAL can host
    - Jeff and Cheryl can help advance this discussion
  - Q. How is ICASA updated?
    - Through Google spreadsheet, but would like to find another way. Looked at Protege/Webprotege -- are up for suggestions.
- Other questions for discussion
  - Q. What about MIAPPE?
    -  [http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MIAPPE.pdf](http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MIAPPE.pdf)
    - ISA Tab [http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/?page\_id=37](http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes/?page_id=37)
  - Q. What about the various ontologies? Agro, Crop Ontology, Crop Research Ontology, etc.
  - Q. Linked data versus a metadata standard?
    - Should we consider supporting validation -- ensuring data conforms to the format?
    - Metadata schemes like EML and DDI include strictly defined schema
    - Should we be defining a strict format (e.g., JSON Schema, XSD), or just providing an authoritative vocabulary that can be used to compose arbitrary data objects?
- Note: RDA Meeting
  - IG Agricultural Data
    -  [https://rd-alliance.org/ig-agricultural-data-igad-rda-8th-plenary-meeting](https://rd-alliance.org/ig-agricultural-data-igad-rda-8th-plenary-meeting)
  - Wheat interoperability -- primarily genomics, very active, would be of interest
  - Cheryl @ GODAN meeting in NY
