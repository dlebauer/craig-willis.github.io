2017 Sensor Metadata Standards Review meeting
===================================

As part of reference-data issues 42 and 54, we've started organizing device and sensor related documentation and metadata. Initial work focused on the LemnaTec "sensor_fixed_metadata" format with minor modifications, stored alongside datasheets and related documentation in Clowder.  We've demonstrated how this information can be used programmatically via the Clowder API.
 
As a next step, we've started work on a linked-data representation (using JSON-LD) intended for use by other groups (e.g., Phenotractor) that leverages existing standards from the OGC/SensorML family. 

In this meeting, we'll present the current implementation and plans going forward for feedback.
