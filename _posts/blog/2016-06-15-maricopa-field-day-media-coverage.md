## Media Coverage of the Maricopa Field Day

There was a lot of great coverage of our Field Day - the public unveiling of the Field Scanner in Maricopa, AZ on June 2 2016.

Casey Kuhn, KJZZ, June 2, 2016

> “It’s like our eyes. We look at crops and we look at how tall they are, how big, how green," Sanchez said, explaining how the machine works. "What we’re doing with this system is using sensors to measure those same elements.”

Jodie Wehrspann, Farm Industry News Blog, June 14, 2016

> The robot, which LemnaTec calls its “Field Scanalyzer,” takes pictures of plants to aide in hybrid research. The process is called phenotyping, and it is designed to accelerate hybrid development.

### ["Robot allows for close monitoring of crop advances"](http://feedstuffs.com/story-robot-allows-close-monitoring-crop-advances-45-142571)

Feedstuffs, June 13, 2016

> Global plant phenotyping specialist LemnaTec has unveiled the largest field robot in the world, capable of continuously monitoring the development of crops under real growing conditions.

### ["New agricultural robotics system will advance use of robotics"](http://www.agprofessional.com/news/new-agricultural-robotics-system-will-advance-use-robotics)

Rich Keller, Ag Professional, June 2, 2016

> Robotics data gathering is needed for the university “to generate and channel extremely large data sets that capture the dynamics of plant growth and response to ambient conditions in the low desert under their natural environment.”

U.S. Department of Energy, June 9, 2016

> Biofuels have huge potential as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for transportation. But farming crops for biofuel takes land, fresh water and other resources that are increasingly scarce as the world’s population rises -- so finding ways to grow them faster and more efficiently is key.
