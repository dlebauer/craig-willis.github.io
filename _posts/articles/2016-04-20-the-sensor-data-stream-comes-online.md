# Data Sources

We currently have the raw data stream generated by the Lemnatec Field Sensors at the Maricopa Agricultural Sensor. 
There is a separate dataset from testing at the Lemnatec Indoor System at the Danforth Center's Bellweather Phenotyping Facility on which we are testing the computing pipeline: using PlantCV to extract phenotypes and BETYdb to store them.

As of writing, only raw binary files and textual meta-data are available for users to explore. 
To follow development of the phenomics data pipelines, please see liinks to GitHub below and [sign up for our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bUzdY9).


## Lemnatec Field Scanner Sensors

Winter wheat was grown in February and March while the sensors were installed and tested. 
We have these data available.

The gantry has been off during the last few weeks and will be turned on again this week as the Sorghum crop is planted.

Here is a brief summary of the sensors that are in place:

# Accessing Data

Data products will expanded, revised, and released annually in November.
The alpha (2016) and beta (2017) versions will be released to TERRA researchers and version 1.0 release (2018) is planned to be fully open access. 
Before this time, we will provide access to data as early and openly as possible, first to the reference data team and standards committee, then to TERRA researchers and collaborators, and finally to the public.

Our goal is to get feedback on the TERRAREF computing pipeline and data products. 
Data are not publicly available at this point, but are available to TERRA scientists and collaborators.
Others may request access, the level of interest will help us develop conditions for academic and commercial use.

## Access and Compute on Data with Clowder

Clowder is an open-source data management platform for research.
See the [Clowder website](https://clowder.ncsa.illinois.edu/) for more information about the software and its applications. 
TERRAREF uses Clowder to organize, annotate, and process  data generated by phenotyping platforms.

The video below demonstrates how to set up and use Clowder locally as well as how to seach for data and launch analysis tools. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCNYEl3ld0s) illustrates the initial TERRAREF infrastructure processing Sorghum test data from Danforth's Bellweather Phenotyping Facility Lemnatec _Indoor_ system. Clowder is not just a website! It is a pipeline conductor that can orchestrate complex data flows.

### Clowder data is organized into **datasets**, **collections** and **spaces**.

* **Datasets** consist of one or more files with associated metadata collected by one sensor at one time point. Users can annotate, download, and use these sensor datasets.
* **Collections** consist of one or more datasets. Currently, we have collections to organize sensors by collection date and sensor. Users can create their own collections.
* **Spaces** consist of collections and datasets. Spaces allow for particular roles to be assigned to particular users.


For **Field Scanner Data**, you can request an account for the [TERRAREF Clowder Interface](http://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/) where this is being tested by clicking **Sign up** in the upper-right corner.

Once access is granted, you can explore collections and datasets through the web interface or the [Clowder API](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/assets/docs/api/index.html). 
Datasets offer a **Metadata** tab that displays associated information; for example, the contents of .json files originally packaged with the data. 
After selecting a dataset, the **Tool sessions** menu on the lower right sidebar allows users to launch analysis tools. Currently, users can choose between launching Rstudio or Jupyter.
These tools support R and Python as well as many familiar programming languages. 
Additional tools can be added based on user demand. 

When you have written code to process data or metadata and you want to share (source or binary) please contact us! Easiest way is to [open a new issue](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/new) or submit a pull request to github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline with your code in a new folder in the [`scripts/`](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/tree/master/scripts) directory; basic syntax is `script [inputs] [outputs]`.

See our [Clowder Documentation](https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/clowder.html) for more details.

## Download data with Globus

Globus provides a way for users to transfer large amounts of data. 
This is how to configure Globus to transfer data to your computer or server:

1. sign up for Globus at [globus.org](https://www.globus.org/)
2. send your Globus id (or University email) to David LeBauer (<a href="mailto:dlebauer@illinois.edu?subject=[TERRAREF Globus Access Request]">dlebauer@illinois.edu</a>) with 'TERRAREF Globus Access Request' in the subject.
3. you will be notified once you have been granted access
1. log into Globus https://www.globus.org
2. add an endpoint for the destination (e.g. your local computer) https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints/create-gcp
3. download and setup Globus Connect (on that page)
4. go to the 'transfer files' page: https://www.globus.org/app/transfer
5. select source
    * Endpoint: `Terraref` 
    * Path: Navigate to sensor you want under `/MovingSensor/`
    * select (click) a folder, e.g., at time of writing the latest stereo sensor data is in `/MovingSensor/stereoTop/2016-04-07/2016-04-07__16-47-22-087/` 
    * select (highlight) files that you want to download
7. at destination
    * select the endpoint that you set up above of your local computer or server
    * select the destination folder (e.g. `/~/Downloads/`)
8. click 'go'
9. files should be on your computer

# Tell us the data and software you want

We are designing and building a substantial set of data products over the next few years. 
Our data is unique, and we do not know apriori which sensors provide the most scientifically valuable information. 
Your feedback will help us identify and prioritize the suite of data products we produce and which interfaces and standards we support.
We are open to working directly with academic and industry partners interested in using our data and software.

## Provide Input on Specific Issues

Here are a few that we are currently working on

* [Method to correct hyperspectral images & convert to reflectance](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/88)
* [Review hyperspectral image: netCDF with Uncorrected Exposure](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/27)
* [Converting binary images to geoTIFF](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/64)
