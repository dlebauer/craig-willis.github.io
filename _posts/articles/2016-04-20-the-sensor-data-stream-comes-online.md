# Data Sources

We currently have the raw data stream generated by the Lemnatec Field Sensors at the Maricopa Agricultural Sensor. 
There is a separate dataset from testing at the Lemnatec Indoor System at the Danforth Center's Bellweather Phenotyping Facility on which we are testing the computing pipeline: using PlantCV to extract phenotypes and BETYdb to store them.


## Lemnatec Field Scanner Sensors

Winter wheat was grown in February and March while the sensors were installed and tested. 
We have these data available.

The gantry has been off during the last few weeks and will be turned on again this week as the Sorghum crop is planted.

Here is a brief summary of the sensors that are in place:

| Description | Camera | Technical Data |
|:-----|:------|:-----|:-----|
| Hyperspectral Imager | Inspector VNIR | 380-1000 nm|
| Hyperspectral Imager | Inspector SWIR | 900-2500 nm|
| Thermal Infrared | FLIR SC 615 | Thermal Sensitivity < 50mK @ 30C|
|   |   | range: -40 to 150 C |
| Dedicated NDVI (1 down, 1 up)  | Skye NDVI Sensors  | CH1: 650 +/- 3nm|
|    |   |  CH2: 800 +/- 3nm |
|    |   | Bandwidth: 10nm +/- 3nm |
|Dedicated PRI Sensor | Skye PRI | CH1: 531nm +/- 3nm |
|   |   | CH2: 570 +/- 3nm |
|   |   | Bandwidth: 10nm  +/- 3nm
| PAR Sensor | Quantum | Spectral Range 410 to 655 nm|
| Color Sensor | STS-Vis | Range: 410-655 nm @ 1nm|
| Top Down Height Scanner| 3D Frauhofer | |  
| Side Looking Laser Scanners (2) | 3D Frauhofer | |
| 8MP RGB Camera Downward Looking | GT3300C | |
| 8MP RGB Camera Side View (2) | GT 3300C | |
| Active Reflectance | Crop Circle ACS430P | 670, 730, 780 nm |
| Fluorescence Measurement | Lemnatec PSII | |
| Environmental Sensors | Thies Clima | Wind, Air T, Humidity
|  |  | Pressure, Light, Precipitation |
| CO2 Sensor | GMP 343 | Range 0-1000ppm |

# Accessing Data

Although data products are scheduled to be released in November of 2016 (alpha version), 2017 (beta) and 2018 (v1 public), we are pleased to provide access as early and openly as possible.

Our goal is to get feedback on the TERRAREF computing pipeline and data products. 
Data are not publicly available at this point, but are available to TERRA scientists and collaborators.
Others may request access, and we are currently developing guidelines and conditions for academic and commercial use.

## Access and Compute on Data with Clowder

Clowder is an open-source data management platform for research. 
See the [Clowder website](https://clowder.ncsa.illinois.edu/) for more information about the software and its applications. TERRAREF uses Clowder to organize, annotate, and process  data generated by phenotyping platforms.

The video below demonstrates how to set up and use Clowder locally as well as how to seach for data and launch analysis tools. This demo was illustrates the Lemnatec _Indoor_ phenomics pipeline.

Clowder consists of Datasets, Collections and Spaces.

* **Datasets** consist of one or more files with associated metadata collected by one sensor at one time point. Users can annotate, download, and use these sensor datasets.
* **Collections** consist of one or more datasets. Currently, we have collections to organize sensors by collection date and sensor. Users can create their own collections.
* **Spaces** consist of collections and datasets. Spaces allow for particular roles to be assigned to particular users.


For **Field Scanner Data**, you can request an account for the [TERRAREF Clowder Interface](http://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/) where this is being tested by clicking **Sign up** in the upper-right corner.

Once access is granted, you can explore collections and datasets through the web interface or the [Clowder API](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/assets/docs/api/index.html). 
Datasets offer a **Metadata** tab that displays associated information; for example, the contents of .json files originally packaged with the data. 
After selecting a dataset, the **Tool sessions** menu on the lower right sidebar allows users to launch analysis tools. Currently, users can choose between launching Rstudio or Jupyter.
These tools support R and Python as well as many familiar programming languages. 
Additional tools can be added based on user demand. 

When you have written code to process data or metadata and you want to share (source or binary) please contact us! Easiest way is to [open a new issue](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/new) or submit a pull request to github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline with your code in a new folder in the [`scripts/`](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/tree/master/scripts) directory; basic syntax is `script [inputs] [outputs]`.

See our [Clowder Documentation](https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/clowder.html) for more details.

## Download data with Globus

Globus provides a way for users to transfer large amounts of data. 
This is how to configure Globus to transfer data to your computer or server:

1. sign up for Globus at [globus.org](https://www.globus.org/)
2. send your Globus id (or University email) to David LeBauer (<a href="mailto:dlebauer@illinois.edu?subject=[TERRAREF Globus Access Request]">dlebauer@illinois.edu</a>) with 'TERRAREF Globus Access Request' in the subject.
3. you will be notified once you have been granted access
1. log into Globus https://www.globus.org
2. add an endpoint for the destination (e.g. your local computer) https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints/create-gcp
3. download and setup Globus Connect (on that page)
4. go to the 'transfer files' page: https://www.globus.org/app/transfer
5. select source
    * Endpoint: `Terraref` 
    * Path: Navigate to sensor you want under `/MovingSensor/`
    * select (click) a folder, e.g., at time of writing the latest stereo sensor data is in `/MovingSensor/stereoTop/2016-04-07/2016-04-07__16-47-22-087/` 
    * select (highlight) files that you want to download
7. at destination
    * select the endpoint that you set up above of your local computer or server
    * select the destination folder (e.g. `/~/Downloads/`)
8. click 'go'
9. files should be on your computer
