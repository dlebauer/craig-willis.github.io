_Please note that TERRA-REF is still under development, data availability is limited at this time._

# Overview
TERRA-REF provides access to direct measurements and sensor observations, derived plant phenotypes, along with genetic and genomic data. Data is accessible via the [TERRA-REF data portal](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/), [phenotype database](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/), and genomics database. 

Basic instructions for accessing the data are provided below.  For more detailed information, see the <a href="https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/user/how-to-access-data.html">documentation</a>.

## Sensor Data
Sensor data is available through the [TERRA-REF Clowder](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/) active data repository.  Clowder is used to organize, annotate, and process data generated by the phenotyping platforms.  Datafiles are available via the Clowder web interface or API.

Access to Clowder requires [registration](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/signup).  After logging in, you will be able to explore available data [organized by platform](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/spaces).

For more information, please see the <a href="https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/user/using-clowder.html">documentation</a>.

## Phenotype Database
Agronomic and phenotype data, including plots and other locations of interest, can be accessed via the [TERRA-REF phenotype database](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/). 

Acccess to the phenotype database requires [registration](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/signup).  After logging in, you will be able search and download trait data.

For more information, please see the <a href="https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/user/using-betydb.html">documentation</a>.

## Genomics Data

TBD
