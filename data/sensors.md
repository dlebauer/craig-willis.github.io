_Please note that TERRA-REF is still under development, data availability is limited at this time._

Sensor data is available through the TERRA-REF [sensor data portal](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/).  The sensor data portal is used to organize, annotate, and process data generated by the phenotyping platforms.  Datafiles are available via web interface or API.

Access to the sensor data portal requires [registration](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/signup).  After logging in, you will be able to explore available data [organized by platform](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/spaces).

For more information, please see the <a href="https://terraref.gitbooks.io/terraref-documentation/content/user/using-clowder.html">documentation</a>.
